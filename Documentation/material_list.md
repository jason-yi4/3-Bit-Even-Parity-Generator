| ITEM | AMOUNT | DESCRIPTION |
| :--: | :----: | :---------: |
| Breadboard | 1 | Used as the main board to connect all circuit components. |
| Wire | 18 | Used as the physical connections between components. |
| Handheld Multimeter | 1 | Used to obtain measured values for the resistances, currents, and voltages within the circuit during the experimental design process. |
| Test Clip Leads | 2 Pairs | Used to connect the *DC Power Supply* and *Multimeter* to the circuit. |
| Quad-SPST Switch Array | 1 | Used to simulate bit inputs for the *Quad-XOR Gate*s. |
| Quad-XOR Gate (74LS86) | 2 | Used for the bitwise addition necessary to correctly generate parity bit. |
| 10kΩ Resistor | 3 | Used to reduce current flowing through each of the inputs of the *Quad-XOR Gate*s when bits are activated. |
| 1kΩ Resistor | 1 | Used to reduce current flowing through LED indicator. |
| DC Power Supply | 1 | Used to supply power to the circuit. |
| LED | 1 | Used as a visual indicator of the generated parity bit. |
